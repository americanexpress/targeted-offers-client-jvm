# Targeted Offers Java SDK
Amex Targeted Offers API is a capability to request instant pre-qualified , prescreened  Card offer(s) for the applicants, if eligible. 
Targeted Offers API provides an interface to interact with systems of American Express. 
â€‹
</br></br>This Java implementation allows Amex partners to integrate seamlessly to Targeted Offers and reduces complexity out of coding service layer integration to Targeted Offers API. The Targeted Offers Java SDK is a simple wrapper to the API. It assumes you have already set up your credentials with American Express and have your certs prepared. See the [authentication and authorization guides](https://developer.americanexpress.com/products/targeted-offers/guide#authentication) for more information.

## Documentation

Please see : [documentation for Amex Targeted Offers API](https://developer.americanexpress.com/products/targeted-offers/overview)

<br/>

## Installation

- Install maven 
    ```
    brew install maven
    ```
- Clone repo
- Go inside px-toa-java-sdk  and type
   ```
    $ mvn clean install
   ```
<br/>

## Compatibility

targeted-offers-client sdk will support Java Version 8 or higher.



<br/>

## Configuring SDK

SDK needs to be configured with OAuth, Mutual Auth and Payload encryption configurations, below is the sample configuration snippet.

```java


```

<br/>

## Authentication

Amex Targeted Offers API uses token based authentication. The following examples demonstrates how to generate bearer tokens using the SDK :

```java
AccessTokenResponse accessTokenResponse = getAuthenticationToken(targetedOffersClient); //success response

				targetedOffersClient.setAccessToken(accessTokenResponse.getAccessToken()); //set the Access Token for further API calls 
})

```
Sample Response : 

```java
{
  scope: 'default',
  status: 'approved',
  expires_in: '3599', // token expiry in seconds, you can cache the token for the amount of time specified.
  token_type: 'BearerToken',
  access_token: 'wJeW9CPT0DbrqBjrTN1xbMQZkae2'
}

```
Note : you can skip this call if you have an active Token in your cache. if you have an active token, you can just set the bearerToken in config under authentication or call `setAccessToken('access_token')` method to update the config.



<br/>

## Offers :

## Getting Offers

Request body and API mandatory fields can be found at [API Specifications](https://developer.americanexpress.com/products/targeted-offers/resources#readme).

```java

TargetedOffersClient targetedOffersClient = createTargetedOffersClient();

TargetedOffersRequest targetedOffersRequest = objectMapper.readValue(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("targetedOffersRequest.json"), TargetedOffersRequest.class);

offersResponse = offersService.getOffers(targetedOffersRequest);

//see src/main/resources for a sample header and body

return offersResponse; //successful response
});

```

This will return an array of offers, you can find more information on response at [reference guide](https://developer.americanexpress.com/products/targeted-offers/resources#readme).

<br/>

## Acknowledging Offers
The `acknowledgeOffers()` method is used to let American Express know that offers were presented to the user. Response will be true if the API call is success.

```java
//applicant_request_tracking_id will be provided as part of the targeted offers response.
acknowledgementRequest.setApplicantRequestTrackingId(offersResponse.getApplicantRequestTrackingId());
				
return offersService.acknowledgeOffers(acknowledgementRequest); //successful response
});

```


<br/>

## Token
The `getSessionToken()` method is used to get a session token. Session Token is required to maintain the session of the user and is only of one time use.

```java
 //applicant_request_tracking_id will be provided as part of the targeted offers response. please pass the value to get session token.
 
TokenRequest tokenRequest = objectMapper.readValue(
	Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream("sessionTokenRequest.json"), TokenRequest.class);

TokenResponse tokenResponse = tokenService.getSessionToken(tokenRequest);
				
return objectMapper.writeValueAsString(tokenResponse)); //successful response

```
Sample Success response: 

```java
{
  SessionToken: eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJjbGFpbXNfcmVxIjoidHJ1ZSIsImFjY2Vzc190eXBlIjoiUyIsInRva2VuX2lkIjoiYXBwbGljYW50X3JlcXVlc3RfdHJhY2tpbmdfaWQiLCJyZXNvdXJjZV9pZCI6IjUyMjRhNjMzLTczNDQtNGZjZi1hOGVkLWU2MzE0NmM2ZmVhOCIsInRva2VuX3R5cGUiOiJTIiwiZXhwIjoxNTgyODY3MTQzLCJqdGkiOiI1YzUyYmNlYi1mNmExLTQ0YTEtOTk4ZS0yYTBjNmFmMDhiYmQiLCJjbGllbnRfaWQiOiJDbGllbnRfSUQifQ.NnmzkiiB08YWZQKWKFvAwAHdcNoqjmkSBc4vNwr0TXu1SBWgEhC4J_3mbunQ_PV8FUq6-n4YI4ogPSTuy570AZJ4sq9e86gE-dIuuOMs2AzsLukeIz5PHuHUP9friqpcKHbOqJFMohBNwsA0IGwA96aB9BJ0yPDqcGgiOtju_QekGJRk6LByHUQevuPsHdZjGCgXpXiqHjOFA3SFycE0NUi2pLnC5VISgG-OFFr0HaoqskcM843UMyGb_MGDKcgMJUhDuHaqqsI4oJ-SmGYs6r88vIlxLvPX-JWuSjI8uLITOYvCq8CQPoKEasLhhu93I_YlZO4B423oJ_OQoIvePw

}
```

<br/>

## Error Handling

In case of exceptions encountered while calling American Express APIs, SDK will throw Errors. For example if all the required fields are not sent, SDK will throw an error object with name `OffersRequestValidationError`. 

if callback function is provided, error will be sent back as the first argument of the callback function.

```java
} catch (OffersException ex) {
	throw ex; // handle exception
} catch (Exception ex) {
     throw new ... // handle exception
	}
}
```
if callback function is not provided, SDK will reject Promise

```java
tokenResponse = tokenService.getSessionToken(tokenRequest);

} catch (OffersException ex) {
	throw ex;
} catch (Exception ex) {
	throw new OffersException(INTERNAL_SDK_EXCEPTION, ex);
}
return tokenResponse; // success
```

Possible exceptions : 
```java
- ResourceNotFoundError // ResourceNotFoundError will be raised when the user is not qualified for PreQualified or PreScreened Offers
 
- OffersAuthenticationError // Authentication errors with the API -- example : invalid API Key or Secret is sent to the API

- OffersRequestValidationError // Request Validation Error -- request or configs provided to the SDK are invalid, you can see more info in err.fields for the fields that failed validations.

- NoOffersAvailable // NoOffersAvailable will be raised when the user is not qualified for a PreQual or PreScreened Offers. 

- OffersAPIError // Is a generic type of error, It will be raised when there is an Internal server error or any other error which is not covered by any of the named errors.

- PayloadEncryptionError // PayloadEncryptionError is a generic type of error for Encryption errors,It will be raised when there is an Exception raised at the Payload encryption. More information will be present in the error message.
```
